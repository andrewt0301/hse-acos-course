Examples of Module Test Tasks
---

Test is (slightly more) complex class task, based on C programming home works.

### Constraints

* All solutions sources must reside at `18_Test` catalog in your account on `sugon` server.

* __Do not touch uploaded code__!
  If you want to improve something afterwards,
  each time create a new directory ``18_Test.1`, `18_Test.2` etc. with full new solution.

* All code should be compiled and should work on `sugon` server.

* All source files should be named __exactly as in the statement__.

* All __temporary__ objects should be named after your login name,
  e. g. for user «socrates», shared memory object (if any) should be named `/socrates`

* Take care either to __remove__ temporary object before creating it again,
  or __do not use__ `O_EXCL` flag when creating.
